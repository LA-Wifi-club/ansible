# Landoop Ansible Roles

In this repository we share some of our ansible roles that we think may be of interest.

We take care to convert them into examples rather than the more complex versions we use
for our specific needs.

Our OS of choice is CentOS 7 and we usually avoid to compensate for different OSes, so
keep this in mind. We like other GNU/Linux distributions too but keeping our systems
uniform helps with the administration burden.
